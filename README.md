# skribble4me

## What is it?

skribbl4me is a command line Python tool that allows you to play the game [skribbl.io](skribbl.io) automatically.

## How does it work?

There are two parts to this project:

1. Guessing.
     - The program uses a dictionary to guess the word.
     - Words are guessed randomly at the start, and are then guessed based on the letters that have been revealed.

2. Drawing.
     - The program uses [skribbl-io-autodraw](https://github.com/galehouse5/skribbl-io-autodraw) to draw the word.
     - *This functionality is currently not implemented.*
